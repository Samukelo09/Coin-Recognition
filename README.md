##  Project Overview

This project aims to identify and classify South African bank coins using an automated pipeline that is invariant to coin side, scale, and rotation. The pipeline includes preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification using both classical machine learning and deep learning (CNNs).

## ðŸ›  Techniques Used

###  Image Preprocessing
- **Denoising**: Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, Bilateral Filter  
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Histogram Equalization, CLAHE  
- **Illumination Correction**: Homomorphic Filtering, Background Subtraction  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)  
  - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)

###  Image Segmentation
- **Morphological Processing**
- **Hough Circle Transform**
- **GrabCut**
- **UNet (TFLite)**

###  Feature Extraction
- **Hu Moments** (Shape descriptors)
- **Haralick Features** (Texture via GLCM)
- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**
- **Color Statistics** (Mean & Standard Deviation across RGB and grayscale)

###  Classification Models

| Segmentation Type      | Model Type       | Accuracy |
|------------------------|------------------|----------|
| Hough                  | RF / MLP         | 40%      |
| Hough                  | CNN              | 95%      |
| GrabCut                | CNN              | 97%      |
| Raw (No Segmentation)  | CNN              | 32%      |
| Morphological          | Feature-based    | 32%      |
| UNet                   | Feature-based    | 99%      |
| UNet + MobileNetV2     | CNN (TFLite)     | 97%      |

> **Note:** SMOTE oversampling was applied to improve model performance in imbalanced datasets.
